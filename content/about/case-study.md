Beam features a User Interface written in TypeScript that uses React and our client library Lens to create a simple task management tool for teams.

The API is powered by Prism and Collimator, which allows us to keep the amount of code written (and therefore maintained) to a minimum, while still supporting a rich level of interaction.

Beam is intended to be a fully functional, production ready tool. This isn't the 'todo-list' toy app that you may see others peddling.
